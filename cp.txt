Look how they shine for you
And everything you do

And all the things you do
And it was called yellow
So then I took my turn
Oh what a thing to have done
And it was all yellow
Your skin

Turn into something beautiful
You know you know i love you so

Oh what a thing to do
Cos you were all yellow

Oh what a thing to do
And it was all yellow
Your skin

Turn into something beautiful
And you know
For you I'd bleed myself dry

Oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo
Oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo
When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
So she ran away in her sleep
And dreamed of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Every time she closed her eyes
Oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo
Oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo
When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
And the bullets catch in her teeth
Life goes on, it gets so heavy
The wheel breaks the butterfly
Every tear a waterfall
In the night, the stormy night
She closed her eyes
In the night, the stormy night
Away she flies
Dream of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
She dreamt of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Lalalalala lalalalala lalalalala lala
So lying underneath the stormy skies
She'd say oh oh oh oh oh
I know the sun's set to rise
This could be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Could be para-para-paradise
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
This could be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Could be para-para-paradise
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
This could be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Could be para-para-paradise
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo...

When you try your best
But you don't succeed
When you get what you want
But not what you need
When you feel so tired
But you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse
And the tears come streaming down your face
When you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone
But it goes to waste
Could it be worse
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you
And high up above or down below
When you're too in love
To let it go
But if you never try you'll never know
Just what you're worth
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you
I see a stream down your face
When you lose something you cannot replace
I see a stream down your face
And I
I see a stream down your face
I promise you I will learn
From all my mistakes
I see a stream down your face
And I
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

Some saw the sun
Some saw the smoke
Some heard the gun
Some bent the bow
Sometimes the wise must tense for the note
Caught in the fire, say oh
We're about to explode
Carry your world, i'll carry your world
Carry your world, i'll carry your world
Some far away
Some search for gold
Some dragon to slay
Heaven we hope is just up the road
Show me the way, lord because I am about to explode
Carry your world, i'll carry your world
Carry your world, i'll carry your world
Carry your world, i'll carry your world

I'm sinking like stones
All that we've fought for

Homes' places we've grown
All of us are done for

We live in a beautiful world

Yeah we do
Yeah we do
We live in a beautiful world

I'm sinking like stones
All that we've fought for

Homes' places we've grown
All of us are done for

We live in a beautiful world

Yeah we do
Yeah we do

We live in a beautiful world

We live in a beautiful world

Yeah we do
Yeah we do

We live in a beautiful world

Oh all that i know
There's nothing here to run from

Cos here' everybody here's got somebody to lean on

I've been reading books of old
The legends and the myths
Achilles and his gold
Hercules and his gifts
Spider Man's control
And Batman with his fists

And clearly I don't see myself upon that list
She said where'd you wanna go
How much you wanna risk
I'm not looking for somebody
With some Superhuman gifts
Some Superhero

Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can kiss
I want something just like this

Doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo
Oh I want something just like this
Doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo
Oh I want something just like this

I want something just like this
I've been reading books of old
The legends and the myths
The testaments they told
The moon and it's eclipse
And Superman unrolls
A suit before he lifts

But I'm not the kind of person that it fits
She said where'd you wanna go
How much you wanna risk
I'm not looking for somebody
With some Superhuman gifts
Some Superhero

Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can miss
I want something just like this
I want something just like this

Oh I want something just like this
Doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo
Oh I want something just like this
Doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo

Where'd you wanna go
How much you wanna risk
I'm not looking for somebody
With some Superhuman gifts
Some Superhero
Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can kiss
I want something just like this

Oh I want something just like this
Oh I want something just like this
Oh I want something just like this

I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own
I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing:
"Now the old king is dead
Long live the king "
One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt' pillars of sand
I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you know there was never'
Never an honest word
That was when I ruled the world
It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever wanna be king
I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world
(Ohhhhh Ohhh Ohhh)
Hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

oh I think I landed
in a world I hadn¡¯t seen
when I¡¯m feeling ordinary
when I don¡¯t know what I mean

oh I think I landed
where there are miracles at work
for the thirst and for the hunger
come the conference of birds

saying it¡¯s true, it¡¯s not what it seems
leave your broken windows open
and in the light just streams
and you get a head, a head full of dreams
you can see the change you wanted
be what you want to be
and you get a head, a head full of dreams
into life I¡¯ve just been spoken
with a head full, a head full of dreams

oh I think I landed
where there are miracles at work
when you got me open-handed
when you got me lost for words
I sing oh-oh-oh

A head full of dreams
A head full of dreams
Into life I¡¯ve just been woken
With a head full, a head full of dreams

been standing in the corner
studying the lights
the dreaming of escape will keep you up at night
but someone had put the flares up
and got me in the rays
so I guess I¡¯d better stay
¡®uh uh no come on¡¯ you say

it¡¯s a fool¡¯s gold thunder
it¡¯s just a warring rain
don¡¯t let the fears just start ¡®what if
I won¡¯t see you again¡¯
around here you never want to sleep all night
so start falling in love, start the riot and

come on rage with me
we don¡¯t need words
and we¡¯ll be birds
got to make our own key

only got this moment
you and me
guilty of nothing
but geography

come on and raise it
come on and raise this noise
for the million people
who got not one voice
come on it¡¯s not over if you
mean it say loud
come on all for Love
out from the underground
away with me
we don¡¯t need words
close your eyes and see
and we¡¯ll be birds
flying free
holding on in the mystery

oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
fearless together
you said ¡®we¡¯ll go through this together¡¯
when you fly won¡¯t you
won¡¯t you take me too?
in this world so cruel
I think you¡¯re so cool

oh angel sent from up above
you know you make my world light up
when I was down, when I was hurt
you came to lift me up

life is a drink and love¡¯s a drug
oh now I think I must be miles up
when I was a river dried up
you came to rain a flood

you said ¡®drink from me, drink from me¡¯
when I was so thirsty
poured on a symphony
now I just can¡¯t get enough
put your wings on me, on me
when I was so heavy
poured on a symphony
when I¡¯m low low low low

I oh I oh I
got me feeling drunk and high
so high so high
oh I oh I oh I
now I¡¯m feeling drunk and high
so high so high

oh angel sent from up above
I feel you coursing through my blood
life is a drink and your love¡¯s about
to make the stars come out

put your wings on me, on me
when I was so heavy
poured on a symphony
when I¡¯m low low low low

I oh I oh I
you got me feeling drunk and high
so high so high
oh I oh I oh I
now I¡¯m feeling drunk and high
so high so high

I oh I oh I
la la la la la la la
so high so high

oh I oh I oh I
now I¡¯m feeling drunk and high
so high so high
that I shoot across the sky
that I shoot across the
that I shoot across the sky
watch me shoot across the

oh they say people come, say people go
this particular diamond was extra special
and though you might be gone, and the world may not know
still I see you, celestial

like a lion you ran,  a goddess you rolled
like an eagle you circled, in perfect purple
so how come things move on, how come cars don¡¯t slow
when it feels like the end of my world
when I should but I can¡¯t let you go?

but when I¡¯m cold, cold
oh when I¡¯m cold, cold
there¡¯s a light that you give me when I¡¯m in shadow
there¡¯s a feeling you give me, an everglow

like brothers in blood, sisters who ride
and we swore on that night we¡¯d be friends til we die
but the changing of winds, and the way waters flow
life as short as the falling of snow
and now I¡¯m gonna miss you I know

but when I¡¯m cold, cold
in water rolled, salt
I know that you¡¯re with me and the way you will show
and you¡¯re with me wherever I go
and you give me this feeling this everglow

oh- I I I I
what I wouldn¡¯t give for just a moment to hold
yeah I live for this feeling this everglow

so if you love someone, you should let them know
oh the light that you left me will everglow

turn your magic on
Umi she¡¯d say
everything you want¡¯s a dream away
and we are legends every day
that¡¯s what she told me

turn your magic on,
to me she¡¯d say
everything you want¡¯s a dream away
under this pressure under this weight
we are diamonds

now I feel my heart beating
I feel my heart underneath my skin
and I feel my heart beating
oh you make me feel
like I¡¯m alive again
alive again
oh you make me feel
like I¡¯m alive again

said I can¡¯t go on, not in this way
I¡¯m a dream that died by light of day
gonna hold up half the sky and say
only I own me
and I feel my heart beating
I feel my heart underneath my skin
oh I can feel my heart beating
cause you make me feel
like I¡¯m alive again
alive again
oh you make me feel
like I¡¯m alive again

turn your magic on, Umi she¡¯d say
everything you want¡¯s a dream away
under this pressure under this weight
we are diamonds taking shape
we are diamonds taking shape

if we¡¯ve only got this life
this adventure oh then I
and if we¡¯ve only got this life
you get me through
and if we¡¯ve only got this life
in this adventure oh then I
want to share it with you
with you
with you
yeah I do
woohoo
woohoo
woohoo

I know it¡¯s over before she says
I know the falls that the water face
I know it¡¯s over
An ocean awaits for a storm
The sun on snow, rivers in rain
Crystal ball can foresee a change
And I know it¡¯s over, a parting of ways
And it¡¯s done
But didn¡¯t we have fun?
Don¡¯t say it was all a waste
Didn¡¯t we have fun
Oh ah ooh ooh ooh

From the top of the world
The top of the waves
We said forever, forever always
We could have been lost
We would have been saved
Oh ah, ooh ooh ooh
Now we¡¯re stopping the world
stopping its spin
but come on don¡¯t give up don¡¯t say we give in
Don¡¯t say it¡¯s over
Don¡¯t say we¡¯re done
Ah didn¡¯t we have fun?

I know it¡¯s over
Before she says
¡®Know someone else has taken your place¡¯
¡®I know it¡¯s over¡¯
Icarus says to the sun
The Sword sinks in
Lightning strikes
And two force, two forces collide
And fight til it¡¯s over
Fight til it¡¯s done
Oh oh oh oh oh
But didn¡¯t we have fun?
Don¡¯t say it was all a waste
Didn¡¯t we have fun?
Oh ah ooh ooh ooh

From the top of the world
The top of the waves
We said forever, forever always
We could have been lost,
We would have been saved
Oh AH ah ah ah
Now we¡¯re stopping the world
Stopping in its tracks but
Nothing¡¯s too broken to find a way back
So before it¡¯s over
Before you run
Ah ah
Didn¡¯t we have fun?

Cause you and me we were always meant to
Always meant to be
We were always meant to always meant to

You and me we were always meant to
Always meant to be

Wooh ooh ooh ooh oo ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
oh oh didn¡¯t we have fun?

But then
Maybe we could again

this being human is a guest house
every morning a new arrival
a joy, a depression, a meanness
some momentary awareness comes
as an unexpected visitor

welcome and entertain them all!

be grateful for whoever comes
because each has been sent
as a guide

Been around the world
The wonders to view
Been around the world
Looking for someone like you
Pyramids try
Babylon too
But the beautifullest treasures lie in the deepest blue

So I never say die
Aim never untrue
I¡¯m never so high as when I¡¯m with you
And there isn¡¯t a fire that I wouldn¡¯t walk through
My army of one is gonna fight for you

Been around the world
The universe too
I¡¯ve been around flying, baby
It¡¯s nothing I wouldn¡¯t do
Tanzaku stars
Lasso the moon
And be standing there beside you right
When the storm comes through

Cause I never say die
Aim never untrue
Never so high as when I¡¯m with you
And there isn¡¯t a fire
That I wouldn¡¯t walk through
My army of one is gonna fight for you
My army of one is gonna fall for you, yeah

Cause you reign
All cause you reign
All cause you reign
My army of one is gonna call it through
Saying my heart is my gun, army of one
Yeah my heart is my gun, army of one
It¡¯s my only weapon, army of one
Saying my heart is my gun, army of one

We sat on a roof, named every star
shared every bruise and showed every scar
hope has its proof put your hand in mine
Life has a beautiful crazy design

and time seemed to say
Forget the world and its weight
And here I just want to stay
Amazing day amazing day

We sat on a roof, named every star
you showed me a place where you can be what you are

And the view, the whole Milky Way
In your eyes, I drifted away
And in your arms I just want to sway
Amazing day amazing day
Amazing day amazing day

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oooh

and I asked
Can the Birds in poetry chime?
can there be breaks in the chaos sometimes?
oh thanks God, must have heard when I prayed
cause now I always want to feel this way
Amazing day, amazing day
Amazing day, amazing day
Yeah, today


fixing up a car to drive in it again
searching for the water hoping for the rain
up and up, up and up
down upon the canvas, working meal to meal
waiting for a chance to pick your orange field
up and up, up and up
see a pearl form, a diamond in the rough
see a bird soaring high above the flood
it¡¯s in your blood, it¡¯s in your blood
underneath the storm an umbrella is saying
sitting with the poison takes away the pain
up and up, up and up it¡¯s saying

how come people struggle how come people break your heart?
break your heart
yes I want to grow yes I want to feel
yes I want to know show me how to heal it up

up and up and up

and you can say what is, or fight for it
close your mind or take a risk
you can say it¡¯s mine and clench your fist
or see each sunrise as a gift
